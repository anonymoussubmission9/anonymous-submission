# FSE-paper

This is the public repository for FSE Submission #379: "Towards Better Graph Neural Neural Network-based Fault Localization Through Enhanced Code Representation".

There are two folders, `DepGraph` and `DepGraphCodeChange`

Put the pkl file in the root directory of the project based on the different methods. Then run `python runtotal.py project_name`. For example, `python runtotal.py Time`. 
All of our Data can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/172F5Gv82hC_Qvsb5eQ_XUw1_98gXcRi7?usp=sharing

The data is Seperated in two folders:
